## FILE: glfsc.conf
#
# Change the settings in this file to configure the behavior of GLFSC.
#
# All settings in this file are set to a default value and commented out.
# This is intentional. To configure a custom value, uncomment only the
# the applicable variable declaration and change the value to suit.
#
# It is not necessary to uncomment *any* of the settings in this file to
# get the default values. Those are already declared in the file
# "defaults.conf". Do not alter that file. Make your customizations here.
#
# You may also define custom values on the command line invocation of GLFSC.
# Command line values are equivalent to modifying this file, and those values
# will be written into the configuration files that GLFSC generates for the
# basesystem. To understand how to declare settings on the command line, please
# see the help section of the GLFSC executable
# (currently "shell> glfsc.sh --help")

## Value: GLFSC_BIARCH
#
# Enables the sections of GLFSC that enable the production of a dual
# architecture machine. This is only useful for makings systems that are
# capable of executing 32 and 64 bit instructions.
#
# NOTE: BIARCH builds have not yet been implemented, so setting this variable
#       to any value will not effect the behavior of GLFSC at this time.
#          - Bryan Baldwin 25th July 2010 16:51
#
# Acceptable values are TRUE and FALSE; default is FALSE
#GLFSC_BIARCH=FALSE

## Value: GLFSC_BIN
#
# Define the path to the GLFSC executables
#
# Acceptable values are any path into which the executables generated during
# a build of GLFSC will be placed. The path should not include any part of the
# path that describes the build location prior to chroot.
#
# For example:
#
# If your pre-chroot bin location is /mnt/glfsc/bin, your value here should be
# "/bin". The default value is /bin.
#GLFSC_BIN=/bin

## Value: GLFSC_ETC
#
# Define the path to GLFSC configuration files
#
# Acceptable values are any path into which configuration files generated during
# a build of GLFSC will be placed. The path should not include any part of the
# path that describes the build location prior to chroot.
#
# For example:
#
# If your pre-chroot etc location is /mnt/glfsc/bin, your value here should be
# "/etc". The default value is "/etc".
#GLFSC_ETC=/etc

## Value: GLFSC_GROUP
#
# Identify the name of the group to be used when building packages with GLFSC.
#
# Acceptable values are any name that satisfies the criteria for a standard
# UNIX user group. It is generally safe using any combination of lowercase,
# alphabetical characters.
#
# The default value is "glfsc".
#GLFSC_GROUP=glfsc

## Value: GLFSC_LIB
#
# Define the path to GLFSC shared executable files
#
# Acceptable values are any path into which shared executable files are
# generated during a build of GLFSC will be placed. The path should not include
# any part of the path that describes the build location prior to chroot.
#
# For example:
#
# If your pre-chroot lib location is /mnt/glfsc/bin, your value here should be
# "/lib". The default value is "/lib".
#GLFSC_LIB=/lib

## Value: GLFSC_SCRIPTS
#
# Define the path to the GLFSC buildscript files
#
# Acceptable values are any path into which GLFSC buildfiles reside. This path
# should not include any part of the path that describes the build location
# prior to chroot.
#
# For example:
#
# If your pre-chroot etc location is /mnt/glfsc/var/lib/scripts, your value here
# should be "/var/lib/scripts". The default value is "/var/lib/scripts".
#GLFSC_SCRIPTS=/var/lib/scripts

## Value: GLFSC_SRC
#
# Define the path to GLFSC source code files
#
# Acceptable values are any path into which the source code files used during
# a build of GLFSC will be found. The path should not include any part of the
# path that describes the build location prior to chroot.
#
# For example:
#
# If your pre-chroot src location is /mnt/glfsc/bin, your value here should be
# "/src". The default value is "/src".
#GLFSC_SRC=/src

## Value: GLFSC_SYSROOT
#
# Define the path to basesystem root.
#
# Acceptable values are any path into which the GLFSC basesystem root will be
# built. This should *only* include the part of the path that describes the
# build location prior to chroot.
#
# For example:
#
# If your pre-chroot etc location is /mnt/glfsc, your value here should be
# "/mnt/glfsc". The default value is "/mnt/glfsc".
#GLFSC_SYSROOT=/mnt/glfsc

## Value: GLFSC_TARGET
#
# Define the GCC target triplet of the architecture for which GLFSC will be
# built.
#
# To ensure that GCC performs a cross compiled build, ensure that the second
# value in the target triplet is not "pc" or "unknown".
#
# For example:
#
# If you wish to build GLFSC for a 32bit Intel cpu, use
# "i686-<custom>-linux-gnu" where <custom> is not a valid GCC target, pc, or
# unknown. The default value is "i686-glfsc-linux-gnu"
#GLFSC_TARGET=i686-glfsc-linux-gnu

## Value: GLFSC_ETC
#
# Define the path to GLFSC temporary toolchain
#
# Acceptable values are any path into which the temporary toolchain files
# will be generated during a build of GLFSC will be placed. The path should not
# include any part of the path that describes the build location prior to
# chroot.
#
# For example:
#
# If your pre-chroot etc location is /mnt/glfsc/tools, your value here should be
# "/tools". The default value is "/tools".
#GLFSC_TOOLS=/tools

## Value: GLFSC_USER
#
# Identify the user that will be used while building packages for GLFSC.
#
# Acceptable values are any name that meets the criteria for a standard UNIX
# username. It is generally safe to use any combination of lowercase,
# alphabetical characters.
#
# The default value is "glfsc".
#GLFSC_USER=glfsc

## Value: CONFIG_SITE
#
# Define the path and filename that will contain your config.site details. If
# used, config.site will allow you to specify certain build parameters without
# needing to include them in every build command. This also simplfies your
# buildscripts. Please note that the buildscripts included with GLFSC will not
# by default specify any special parameters in any build commands that can be
# included in the config.site file.
#
# !!! WARNING !!!
# Ensure that this value doesn't point to any config.site file for your host
# system unless this is explicitly what you want to do.
#
# The default value is ${HOME}/config.site, where ${HOME} will by default expand
# to /home/glfsc.
#CONFIG_SITE=${HOME}/config.site

## Value: CONFIG_SHELL
#
# Define the name of the shell program used to build packages in GLFSC. GNU Bash
# is used in the development of GLFSC and is highly recommended to use here.
#
# The default value is ${GLFSC_TOOLS}/bin/bash, where ${GLFSC_TOOLS} will expand
# to the path where the GLFSC temporary toolchain files are located ensuring
# that the most recently built version of the shell is used at any given point
# in the build.
#CONFIG_SHELL=${GLFSC_TOOLS}/bin/bash

## Value: LC_ALL
#
# Define the default internationalization locale for the GLFSC basesystem.
#

#LDFLAGS="-s"

## Value: TZ
#
# Define the timezone for which the GLFSC system should be built. This is any
# valid timezone, and is declared in the format <region>/<location>
#
# For example:
#
# If you are on the east coast of the United States, you could set this value
# to "Amercia/New_York". The default value is "America/New_York".
#TZ='America/New_York'
