# !!! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE !!!
# 
# Although changing this file can result in changing the behavior of GLFSC
# in useful ways, what you really want to do is add/change/remove the settings
# in the file "glfsc.conf" which should be in the same directory as this file,
# or define the values you want as command line flags. See the help section
# from the GLFSC executable (currently "shell> glfsc.sh --help")
#
# The values of this file are always read first on any invocation of GLFSC.
# Absoluting any customization can be done in other files. All other config
# files always override the values in this file. The reason that any value in
# this file would be used at runtime is if no other value given by the user or
# in any other file makes the same setting. You have been warned.
